        </div>
        <p>
            The original inhabitants of Patagonia consisted mostly of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehuelche_people" target="_blank">Tehuelche</a> Indians,
            who are thought to have come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego" target="_blank">Tierra del Fuego</a>.
            The most ancient artifacts, such as harpoons, found in the caves along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Magellan" target="_blank">Strait of Magellan</a>
            suggest that these people were moving up the mainland coast about 5,100 years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            The robust and tall Tehuelche were divided into northern and southern groups, each with its own dialect.
            Spanish explorers found the Tehuelche living as nomadic hunters of guanaco and rhea.
            The surviving descendants of these people are few in number, nearly all of them having been assimilated into Spanish culture.

            The name Patagonia comes from the word <i>patag√≥n</i>. Magellan used this term in 1520
            to describe the native tribes of the region, whom his expedition through to be giants.
            The people he called the Patagons are now believed to have been the Tehuelche,
            who tended to be taller than Europeans of the time.

            Patagonia is a geographical region that encompasses the southern end
            of South America, governed by Argentina and Chile. The region comprises the
            southern section of the Andes Mountains with lakes, fjord, temperate rainforests,
            and glaciers in the west and deserts, tablebands, and steppes to the east.
        </p>
        <p>
            The geological limit of Patagonia has been proposed to be Huincul Fault,
            which forms a major discontinuity. The fault truncate various structure including
            the Pampean orogen found further north. The ages of base rocks change abruptly across the fault.

            <h2>Patagonia Mountains</h2>

        <p>
            Not to be confused with its similiarly named mountains on the border of Argentina and Chile,
            the other Patagonia Mountains sit in southern Arizona about 15 miles from the Mexican border.
            The mountains-which ascend to over 7,000 feet-provide the scenic backdrop for the quiet town of Patagonia,
            as well as a major portion of the town's water supply.The Patagonia Mountains have been inhabited on and off indigenous peoples,
            namely the Sobaipuri O'odham and Hohokam, for approximately 10,000 years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Patagonia Mountains have six different biological provinces: the Rocky and Sierra Madre Mountains, the Sonoran and
            Chihuahuan Deserts, the Great Plains, and the Neo Tropics. Because of this unique intersection of habitats and ecosystems,
            the area has 300 species of birds, 600 species of bees, 300 species of butterflies and moths, 14 hummingbird species, 
            and 2 species of nectar-feeding fruit bats. In addition, the Mountains serve as a breeding ground and seasonal migration path
            for jaguars and ocelots.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, there are 112 federal threatened, endangered, and sensitive species in the Patagonia Mountains.
            They are also part of the Madrean Pine-Oak Woodlands whics scientists have said is one of the top places
            in the world in need of protection for species survival.
            These mountains are everyone's backyard, and the protection of the mountains' unique corridors and biodiversity will
            set the stage for the health of the planet. With such a unique ecosystems, any of the usual devastation or degradation from mining would be catastrophic.
