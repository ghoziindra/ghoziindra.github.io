                I have seen some say “Data Engineering is not an entry level role” and this is nothing more than toxic gatekeeping.
                Data Engineering is no more, and no less, complex than any other software discipline.
                Every discipline is open to newbies. If you want to get into data, you can do it.
                You don’t need to “graduate” into it from a different discipline.
